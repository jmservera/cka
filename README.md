# CKA Study guide and helpers

In this repo I'm taking all my notes and I also provide some scripts to run a VM with 
[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and [vscode server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server)

## Components

* Infra: scripts to deploy the VM
* kind: scripts to install all you need to run kind and vscode remotely on a VM
* deployments: example deployments from the course
